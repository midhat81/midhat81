As a Machine Learning Engineer at Inoviks Soft Solution from 2019 to 2023, I specialized in developing and implementing advanced algorithms and techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). With over four years of hands-on experience, I successfully designed and executed complex models for tasks such as object detection and tracking using YOLO and Faster R-CNN, image segmentation with U-Net and Mask R-CNN, and feature extraction and representation. My expertise also extends to NLP applications, including sentiment analysis, entity recognition with NLTK and SpaCy, and topic modeling. Additionally, I have significant experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, integrating these technologies to enhance NLP capabilities and create innovative solutions. My proficiency in Python and its libraries, including Scikit-Learn, has enabled me to deliver cutting-edge solutions tailored to meet diverse and complex requirements.
