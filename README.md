I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Inoviks Soft Solution, where I develop and implement state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). With over four years of hands-on experience, I have successfully designed and executed complex models for tasks such as object detection and tracking, image segmentation, feature extraction and representation, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition, using Python libraries and frameworks such as NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-Learn, YOLO, Faster R-CNN, U-Net, and Mask R-CNN.
