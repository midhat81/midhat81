As a Machine Learning Engineer at Inoviks Soft Solution, I specialize in developing and implementing cutting-edge algorithms and techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). With over four years of hands-on experience, I have successfully designed and executed complex models for tasks such as object detection and tracking using YOLO and Faster R-CNN, image segmentation with U-Net and Mask R-CNN, and feature extraction and representation. My expertise extends to NLP applications, including sentiment analysis and entity recognition with NLTK and SpaCy, as well as topic modeling. Additionally, I have substantial experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, integrating these technologies to enhance NLP capabilities and create innovative solutions. My proficiency with Python and its libraries, including Scikit-Learn, enables me to deliver state-of-the-art solutions tailored to meet complex requirements.
